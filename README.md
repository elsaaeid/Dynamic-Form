# Overview
#### The Dynamic Form Validation Project is a web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates how to dynamically create form fields and validate user inputs in real-time. By combining dynamic form creation with robust validation techniques, the project ensures that user-submitted data is accurate, complete, and in the expected format.
### This project is ideal for learning how to handle DOM manipulation, event handling, and form validation using vanilla JavaScript.

# Technologies Used
- HTML: For structuring the form and webpage layout.
- CSS: For styling the form and making it visually appealing.
- JavaScript: For adding dynamic functionality and validating user inputs.

# How It Works
## Dynamic Form Creation:
- Users can click a button to dynamically add new input fields to the form.
- Each field includes a "Remove" button to delete it if needed.
## Validation Rules:
- Fields are validated based on their type (e.g., text, email, number).
- JavaScript checks for required fields, correct formats (e.g., email format), and other constraints.
## Custom Error Messages:
- If a field is invalid, a custom error message is displayed below the field.
- The error messages disappear once the input is corrected.
## Form Submission:
- The form can only be submitted if all fields pass validation.
- Invalid fields are highlighted to guide the user.
